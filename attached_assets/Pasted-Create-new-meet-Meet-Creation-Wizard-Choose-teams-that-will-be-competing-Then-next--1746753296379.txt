        * Begin Meet
    * If the individual judging pad option was chosen then show QR code for the judges to Scan
        * QR code should take the judges device to a screen that logs them into the judging pad
    * Load meet running screen there should be a well laid out screen that shows all relevant info to run a dive meet - show current diver scores and the option to edit a dive in the middle of the meet there also should be a button to renounce the dive
        * Beginning with the AI meet runner the AI voice (maybe we can use VAPI) would run the meet like a human. “ Good morning and welcome everyone to today meet between Union and Vassar, please refrain from flash photography during the competition” “We will begin today’s competition with Mens 3m and womens 1m” Megan from Union College will be performing 105c Forward 2.5 ss tuck on deck Steven”
        * The ai voice would then read the judges scores once entered from the judging pads or from the device and say “Judges scores 7,7,6” and then launch into announcing the next diver
        * After the last diver the ai announcer would say “this concludes the mens 3m and women’s 1m” the announcer would proceed to read the scores off in reverse place order
        * The human running the meet would have the option to move to the next event or finish the meet and post the scores at the conclusion of the meet results should be emailed immediately to all parties that participated in the meet both links and actual pdf generated sheets from the meet
