* Add some sort of video component where we can live stream but also auto clip the whole meet and save the dive videos to the divers profiles
* Could emphasize the social element. Could have a profile for each diver that could be public and searched for recruiting and just sharing with family and friends
* Could add practice video as well - eventually maybe a computer vision component where ai knows or recognizes the person and can create a reel of each practice for the divers to watch back but could also track stats like
    * Number of entries
    * And eventually even certain dives
    * To start even being able to track volume or balks would be incredible
    * Maybe could hook into the team video play back system or even add that in as a feature
